Pastor Taylor arrived at Hartwell Baptist Church in January of 2016.  His testimony reads as follows:

Born to church going parents on the first day of May, 1962, Keith proceeded to waste 33  years of his life. During that time he played the church game. He attended nearly  every service, was elected President of his church youth group at 16. Started teaching  the Bible on a weekly basis in Children’s Church at age 12. Was given a Bible Award by Highland High School in Anderson, Indiana (a government school) for expertise  in Bible knowledge. He worked bus routes; attended Tennessee Temple University, graduated Baptist Bible College (Springfield, MO), was a Song Leader, Sunday School Teacher,  Assistant Pastor, Treasurer, Missions Committee Member and even was the Pastor of  independent, fundamental, Baptist churches in Indiana, Texas, and Iowa. BUT HE WAS  LOST.

A series of events were used by God between April of 1994 and June 1995 that reduced his pride and caused him to see his need for Christ. In April of 1994, Bro. Dave McCracken and Bible Baptist Church in Stillwater, Oklahoma, extended a helping hand  to his family. He had just completed a three-week Bible study on why the King James  Bible was the right Bible. The result was a meeting of the deacons wanting to use the NIV like everyone else.

While at Bible Baptist Church he was given the title part time staff and helped in janitorial work, substitute teaching in the Adult Sunday School department, filling the pulpit, and trying to serve as called upon. After a few weeks, Bro. McCracken introduced Bro. Taylor to evangelist Mike Hays a Biblical Counselor from Oklahoma City. Bro. Hays and Bro. Taylor met several times over the course of the year. But it was the second week of May, 1995 that things began to change rapidly.

That Tuesday night, Bro. Hays was preaching a revival at Calvary Baptist Church in Edmond, Oklahoma. After the services, he asked Bro. Taylor if he had a few minutes. He agreed that he did and the two went back into a baptismal changing room on the right side of the auditorium. They sat at a game table, in a small room. After exchanging greetings, Bro. Hays said the most hateful things he had ever heard, “Bro. Keith, I do not see one shred of evidence in your life that would convince me you were saved.” Oh the thoughts that traveled very quickly through the mind.

“How dare he say something like that. I had been faithful to church for years. I had preached to some great crowds and seen souls saved. My family was faithful in working bus routes and giving to missions. I can not believe this man is called of God!” After a few minutes the meeting was over. The 55 minute drive back to Stillwater was quiet. A couple of weeks went by and Bro. Taylor had the opportunity to go to his 10 year Bible College Class Reunion. As he got on campus he felt as empty as a cardboard box. The school meant nothing. The preaching meant nothing. The singing meant nothing. But God was at work.

Then came the morning of June 25, 1995. Bible Baptist Church was using a series of Sunday School lessons called from “Creation to Calvary” by New Tribes Missions. The lesson theme was “You Could Only Come to God His Way.” The lesson had been prepared and the teaching was beginning. As the text was being read in Mark 7:20-23 the Holy Spirit of God took a big club and smacked the teacher in the head.

> *“And he said, That which cometh out of the man, that defileth the man. For from within, out of the heart of men, proceed evil thoughts, adulteries, fornications, murders, Thefts, covetousness, wickedness, deceit, lasciviousness, an evil eye, blasphemy, pride, foolishness: All these evil things come from within, and defile the man.”* (Mark 7:20-23)

After reading these verses it was as if the whole class was pointing their fingers in the direction of the teacher and screaming, “Lost! Lost!” But having more pride and savvy than to admit anything, the class went on. Class was dismissed and church would soon begin.

As the service began, Bro. Taylor sat reading Mark 7:20-23 over and over again. During the song service, the announcements, the special music, and even during the preaching those verse were nearly worn out from reading. That afternoon they kept replaying over and over again. The evening service came and still those verses were being read. Finally, about 8:00 pm Keith got up from the seat, took his Pastor by the hand and said, “I’m lost, I need to be saved.” Bro. McCracken then asked, “How long have you known?” After a pause the answer came, “I guess for over 10 years.” We bowed at the altar and Bro. McCracken said, “Stay and pray until you have peace with God.”

June 25, 1995 I was gloriously saved. I have never been the same since.  Hallelujah!!

Bro. Taylor has studied diligently and is very serious about preaching.  He holds a Master Degree in Counseling and a Master Degree in Theology.  He also has earned a Doctor of Theology and a Doctor of Ministry. His wife Cynthia has a love and heart for God and they have been married for 35 years.
